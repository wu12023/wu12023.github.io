Hi, I'm [**Yiming Shi**](https://shiym.top/about/), an undergraduate at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) enrolled in the Internet+ Dual Degree Program. 
I'm pursuing a BSc in Computer Science and a BEc in Finance.

## Current Position

I'm currently an intern at [TSAIL](https://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/) at Tsinghua University, co-advised by [Prof. Jun Zhu](http://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jun/) and [Dr. Zehua Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wa04fD4AAAAJ&hl=en). Currently I'm working with [Dr. Duo Su](https://suduo94.github.io/) in the area of dataset distillation, with a focus on Efficient AI.
