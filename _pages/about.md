Hi, I'm [**Yiming Shi**](https://shiym.top/about/), an undergraduate in the ***Internet+ Dual Degree Program*** at the [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (**UESTC**)](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/).

I'm majoring double in **Computer Science and Technology** and **Finance**.

## Current Position

I'm currently an intern at [**TSAIL**](https://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/) at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/index.htm), co-advised by [Prof. Jun Zhu](http://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jun/) and [Dr. Zehua Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wa04fD4AAAAJ&hl=en). Currently I'm working with [Dr. Duo Su](https://suduo94.github.io/) in the area of dataset distillation, with a focus on Efficient AI.

## News

- [24/10/18] Our paper "LoLDU: Low-Rank Adaptation via Lower-Diag-Upper Decomposition for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning" has been published on arXiv. You can read the full paper [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13618). Our code can be accessed at [here](https://github.com/SKDDJ/LoLDU).

- [24/08/11] Our paper "DiffLoRA: Generating Personalized Low-Rank Adaptation Weights with Diffusion" has been published on arXiv. You can read the full paper [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06740).

- [24/01/12] In the final round of the [International Algorithm and Case Competition (IACC)](https://iacc.pazhoulab-huangpu.com/contestdetail?id=64af50464a0ed647faca6266&award=1,000,000), we secured the 4th place (ranked 4/815). Our code is [available](https://github.com/SKDDJ/GHM-Greater-Bay-AI-Challenge-Final-Round). You can find our award certificate [here](../files/xiugo-certificate.pdf).



## Previous Experience

## Research Interests

My research primarily focuses on the following areas:

- **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)**
- **Diffusion Models**
- **Dataset Distillation**
- **Schrodinger Bridge**
- **Multimodal**

I'm deeply passionate about deep learning and its applications in these fields.
